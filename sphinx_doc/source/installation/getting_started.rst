Getting Started
=========================================

The Niryo ROS Stack can be installed in multiple target OS:

- Raspberry Pi 3
- Raspberry Pi 4
- Desktop

As the stack is based on ROS Melodic or Kinetic, you need to be on a system based on Ubuntu. 
We currently support the following versions:

- Ubuntu 16.04 :doc:`ubuntu_16`
- Ubuntu 18.04 :doc:`ubuntu_18`
- Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2) - Ubuntu 18.04 :doc:`wsl`
